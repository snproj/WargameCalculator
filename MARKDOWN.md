Ah, nostalgia. This was my first ever attempt to program anything serious. It's unfinished, but that's because the rabbit hole that this project sent me off on was to start my interest in computing in general.

I remember reading for the first time about OOP and being confused about getters and setters; when I implemented it I unconsciously made a giver method that gives to the getter method that gets for the actual method that is using the thing... interesting nonsense.
